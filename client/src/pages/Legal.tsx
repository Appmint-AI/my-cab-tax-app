                  <p>The "Tax Vault" is My Cab Tax USA's secure, redundant data storage service available exclusively to Pro Tier subscribers. The Tax Vault provides:</p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 mt-2">
                    <li>Encrypted storage of all financial records, mileage logs, expense data, and receipt images</li>
                    <li>Geographically redundant backups to protect against data loss</li>
                    <li>Guaranteed availability and data integrity for the duration of an active Pro subscription</li>
                    <li>Tamper-evident audit trails for all record modifications</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p className="mt-2">The Tax Vault is designed to help drivers maintain IRS-compliant records for the recommended 7-year retention period. However, the Tax Vault does not constitute legal or tax advice, and My Cab Tax USA makes no representations about the legal sufficiency of stored records for any particular audit or proceeding.</p>

                  <div className="space-y-2">
                    <p>If a Pro subscription lapses (due to non-payment, cancellation, or any other reason), the following terms apply:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
                      <li><strong>30-Day Grace Period:</strong> Upon subscription lapse, you will have a 30-day grace period to download all of your data, including receipt photos, tax summaries, and any Audit Pack exports.</li>
                      <li><strong>Post-Grace Period:</strong> After the 30-day grace period expires, your account will revert to Free Tier status. Receipt photos and any Pro-exclusive data will be permanently deleted. Text-based records (income, expenses, mileage) will be retained under Free Tier terms (90-day inactivity rule).</li>
                      <li><strong>Re-subscription:</strong> If you re-subscribe to Pro within the 30-day grace period, your Tax Vault data will be fully restored and the 7-year retention guarantee will resume without interruption.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                  <h3 className="font-semibold text-base mb-2">4.6 Good Standing Requirement</h3>
                  <p>The 7-year data retention guarantee is contingent upon the Pro account remaining in "good standing," which means: the subscription is current and not past due, the account has not been suspended or terminated for violation of our Terms of Service, and the user has not submitted fraudulent or illegal data. My Cab Tax USA reserves the right to terminate accounts that violate these conditions.</p>

                  <p>Pro Tier pricing is published on our website and may be updated from time to time. We will provide at least 30 days' notice before any price increase takes effect. Existing subscribers will be grandfathered at their current rate until their next renewal cycle after the notice period.</p>
